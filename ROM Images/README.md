The binary files for the known Boot ROMs for Model II and 12 are here. They are not modified and were added for your convenience.\
Advice is to take the 9733 version as that is the latest.\
1BBE is used by TRS80GP (as of 2025).\
All boot rom images are 2Kbyte and fit in a 2716 EPROM or 28C16 EEPROM.\
When using a 2732 type EPROM in the ROM socket, place the image file in the upper 2K when programming the chip.
